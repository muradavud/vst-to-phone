# VST to Phone
Stream your mixes from your DAW to your phone!

Currently, the only existing commercial product offering similar functionality is prohibitively expensive.

Note: The mobile app is currently only available for Android, and the VST plugin has been tested exclusively on Windows 11 with FL Studio.

## Get Started
1. Download the zip file (green "Code" button above) and place the VstToPhone3.vst3 folder into your plugins directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3 on Windows).
2. Download the Android client from [here](https://github.com/muradavud/vst-to-phone-client) and install it on your device.
3. Open the plugin in your DAW and the app on your phone, ensuring both your PC and phone are connected to the same network. Make sure your DAW has neccessary firewall permissions.


   
Important: On Windows versions between 8.1 and Vista, the universal runtime library might not be installed. This will prevent the plugin from functioning properly.
